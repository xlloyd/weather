Implement weather icons: Instead of just displaying the text for weather conditions, you can use weather icons to visually represent the weather. You can find weather icon sets online or create your own custom icons.

Add forecast information: Extend your application to provide weather forecasts for multiple days. You can display the forecasted temperature, weather condition, and any other relevant information for each day.

Implement unit conversion: Allow users to switch between different units for temperature, wind speed, and pressure. You can provide buttons or dropdown menus to select the desired units and update the displayed values accordingly.

Include additional weather data: Expand the information displayed to include additional weather data such as sunrise and sunset times, visibility, UV index, etc. These details can provide a more comprehensive overview of the weather conditions.

Improve the UI: Consider enhancing the user interface by adding styling, such as using custom fonts, colors, and layouts. You can also experiment with different widget arrangements to make the application more visually appealing.

Add location detection: Implement the ability to detect the user's current location automatically. This can be done using geolocation APIs or by using the IP address of the user's device. By detecting the location, you can provide the weather information for the user's current location without them needing to input it manually.

Incorporate data caching: To improve performance and reduce the number of API requests, you can implement a caching mechanism to store previously fetched weather data. This way, if the user searches for the same location multiple times within a short period, you can retrieve the data from the cache instead of making a new API request.

Provide weather alerts and notifications: If there are severe weather conditions or weather alerts for a specific location, you can notify the user by displaying a message or a pop-up notification. This can help users stay informed about any critical weather updates.

Implement a historical weather feature: Allow users to search for weather data from past dates. This can be useful for users who want to check the weather for a specific day in the past or analyze weather patterns over time.
